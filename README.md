### How to work with STRIPE!
 - register your account in [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
 - need to head into our Stripe dashboard and grab our API keys.Take that key and store it in your .env
 - The Stripe CLI is very handy for testing webhooks. Simply install the [CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and login to your Stripe account so that you are ready to continue.
 - Once your CLI is installed and ready, run the following command in a new terminal: 
 - stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8000/webhook/
 - You should notice in the terminal that Stripe gives you a webhook secret key. Take that key and store it in your .env


Run migrations and run server:
